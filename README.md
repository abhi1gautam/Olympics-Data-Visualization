# Olympics-Data-Visualization
This Repo consists of the project files and report of the Olympics Data Visualization Project that I did recently.

The code uses Python's Streamlit and Altair library for graphs. You can interact with the graphs too if you run the codes:

```streamlit run q1_host_country_effect.py```

```streamlit run q2_economic_effect.py```

The third question is addressed using Tableau. *Olympics Visualizations Final.twbx*

The report is **AbhisekGautam_Task3PartB_13679042.pdf**.

If you are coming here from medium, Suggest you to have a play with the code for better understanding.
