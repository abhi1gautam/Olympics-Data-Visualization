# Olympics Data Visualization
This Repo consists of the project files and report of the Olympics Data Visualization Project that I did recently.

Report questions:
1.	What effect does the host country have in the medals won at the Olympics?
2.	Is the performance of countries in Olympic games affected by the economic factors of the country?
3.	Is the age of winning Olympics changing?

The code uses Python's Streamlit and Altair library for graphs. You can interact with the graphs too if you run the python codes.

Python is used to generate visualizations for two research questions, and Tableau was used to generate visualizations for the third question.

```streamlit run q1_host_country_effect.py```

```streamlit run q2_economic_effect.py```

The third question is addressed using Tableau. *Olympics Visualizations Final.twbx*

The entire report is **AbhisekGautam_Task3PartB_13679042.pdf**.

If you are coming here from medium, Suggest you to have a play with the code for better understanding.

Thanks for reading.
